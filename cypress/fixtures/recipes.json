This is my most popular recipe on my blog  which you can find here: http://sallycooks.com/2013/06/27/crockpot-cashew-chicken/ Happy cooking!I know you know how bad take-out Chinese food is for your waistline and your wallet.  The good news is that it is easy  to make your favorites at home, using less sodium and more fresh or frozen produce.In about the time it takes to order and pick up Chinese, you can make a healthier version of cashew chicken with this simple, throw it all in the crockpot recipe.  I think if I were to make this again I would roast the cashews to crisp them up and add them before serving rather than cooking them alongside the chicken.   I used frozen broccoli but fresh would be fine too.I served with a green salad but my Better-than-Takeout Chicken Fried Rice would be a great side, just leave out the chicken.What to do:layer chicken, cashews and vegetables in the crockpotcombine remaining ingredients except water and pour over chicken in crockpotadd water or broth if necessary so mixture is almost completely coveredcook for 2-4 hours on high or 4-8 hours on low",

You can find the original and all my other recipes here: http://sallycooks.com/2013/11/23/cauliflower-mash-with-roasted-garlic/  This one comes from one of my favorite pages in the magazine titled “Mashed Vegetables 10 ways” The pages are filled with brightly colored mashed vegetables including beets, celery root and rutabagas.  I’ve been meaning to try mashed cauliflower after seeing it make the rounds on Pinterest for some time so I gave it a whirl in my food processor (pun intended) and found it to be pretty delicious!  It would be a great side dish in place of traditional mashed potatoes this Thanksgiving.I added roasted garlic to the recipe to give the cauliflower mash a richer flavor.  It’s easy to roast garlic in a few steps.Simply preheat your oven to 400 degrees, peel off the outer layers of the garlic bulb skin, leaving the skins of the individual cloves intact. Using a knife, cut off the top of cloves, exposing the individual cloves of garlic.",

            "step": "This recipe is number twenty-one in my Thirty for Thanksgiving project where I’m cooking thirty recipes inspired by the November issue of Food Network Magazine and hopefully sharing some that you’ll want to serve for Thanksgiving.  You can find more recipes here: http://sallycooks.com  So far this is my favorite recipe from the November issue because it tasted amazing and was a big hit with Joe. I made a few changes to the recipe; I added more chocolate and instead of three cups of milk, I used 1 and 1/2 cups of milk and 1 and 1/2 cups of coffee to give the pudding a slight mocha taste.  I also left out the dark rum and doubled up on the vanilla extract.  If you want to add in rum use 1 tablespoon dark rum and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  I skipped the step to strain the pudding through a sieve into a medium bowl and I found that the pudding was perfectly smooth.    The pudding can be refrigerated for up to 3 days so this would be a great dessert to make ahead and wow your guests especially if you have some homemade whipped cream.  It was so good.  What to do:melt the butter in a saucepanadd the chocolate and stir until melted and smoothadd milk and 1/3 cup of the sugar over medium heat until it is steamingwhisk the remaining 2/3 cup sugar, the cocoa, cornstarch and salt in a medium bowl, whisk in the eggs, egg yolk and creamgradually whisk into hot milk and chocolate mixturebring to a boil, whisking oftenand scraping the side of the saucepan, reduce the heat to low and let bubble for 30 secondsremove the saucepan from the heat, I like to transfer the pudding into a pitcher while it is still warm so I can pour it cleanly into my dishesadd vanilla and spoon the pudding into 6 jars or bowlslet the pudding cool at room temperature until tepid, about 1 hour, then refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hourstop with whipped cream",

You can find the original recipe and many more on my blog here: http://sallycooks.com/2013/11/14/vidalia-onion-gratin-baked-bloomin-onions/I scaled the recipe to serve two and added the cornflake topping but this would be great for a crowd if you increased the proportions and made it in a large casserole dish.  You could also use bread crumbs in place of cornflakes. I love the sweetness of Vidalia onions with the robust herbs and and crispy, buttery cornflakes.  In my husband's words,  ”this tastes like a bloomin’ onion!”What to do:preheat oven to 375 degreeslayer onions in a buttered baking dishcombine herbs, spices and olive oil, mixing well and pour over each onioncombine crushed cornflakes and butter until well mixed and sprinkle over onionsbake for 20-30 minutes depending on how large your onions are, they’re ready to serve when they’re tender and translucent and the cornflakes are a golden brown",
