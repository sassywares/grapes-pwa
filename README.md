# Grape 🍇

## Project setup

Grape uses Ionic and Ionic uses NPM so don't think about using yarn on pnpm or something else.

```bash
npm install
```

Grape also uses Vite as the build system and it's pretty fast.

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing

Grape uses Vitest for testing and it's the best thing out there.

```bash
npm run test
```

### Release

Grape uses Changesets for releasing.

```bash
npm run release
```
